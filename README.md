# SlashData Presentation

Here I have included the Python code for the analysis used in the Data Storytelling presentation. Interactive charts and full presentation may be found at https://www.100humans-data.com/dataPres/slashData.html 

Notes: 
Github tries to render the Network Analysis, however the clustering algorithm is somewhat time-consuming. Hit refresh to load the code if it does not appear on first page load.
